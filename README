  v0.1

 (c) 2012, fG! - reverser@put.as - http://reverse.put.as

This is a very simple IDA plugin to extract a Mach-O binary contained anywhere in the disassembly.

For now it is able to extract isolated 32 and 64bits binaries, not fat binaries.
Support for fat binaries will be added soon.

You need to position the cursor at the binary start address (Mach-O magic values 0xFEEDFACE or 0xFEEDFACF).

Tested with IDA 6.3 Mac OS X version.

To compile for OS X use the Makefile or the XCode Project.
The Makefile is easier to use since you just need to set the __EA64__ environment variable if you want to compile
to IDA 64bits version.

You will need to edit the Makefile or the XCode project and set the paths to the SDK.
Refer to http://reverse.put.as/2011/10/31/how-to-create-ida-cc-plugins-with-xcode/ for XCode.
Set the environment variable __EA64__ if you want the plugin for IDA 64bits.

For Windows, DEVC++ project file is included for IDA 32 and 64 bits versions.
You will need to edit the DEVC++ project and set the paths to the SDK and plugin binary output.
Please refer to http://www.binarypool.com/idapluginwriting/ for more information.
You should do a Rebuild All in DEVC++ (especially if you switch from 32 to 64 project or vice-versa).

No default shortcut is set. 
Edit IDAP_hotkey at extractmacho.cpp to your own preference if you wish so.

Bug reports, fixes and patches are welcome: reverser@put.as
or github.com/gdbinit/extractmacho

IDA BUGS:
Another bug is related to the PLUGIN_UNL flag. It is used to "Unload the plugin immediately after calling 'run'.".
If this option is set, it crashes the Windows version. Mac version seems do to fine with it.

That's it! Enjoy :-)

fG!

v0.1 - Initial version that supports 32 and 64bits isolated binaries.
